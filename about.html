    The gentle elegance of a comfortable small hotel offering first class warmth
    and caring service, awaits you on arrival in this famous landmark.
    
    For over 100 years, visiting members of Royal families, international and
    local statesmen, celebrities and businessmen have preferred to stay at the PETRUS
    Royal hotel, where each guest is assured of privacy, comfort and care.
    
    Nestled in the heart of the " Battlefields Route " the countryside is steeped
    in history, a history of conflict, bravery and survival, where battles
    between Zulu, Brit, Boer and Voortrekker shaped the history of South Africa.
    
    The perfect place to mix business with pleasure and conveniently located
    midway between Durban and Johannesburg, makes this Hotel the ideal
    destination for business executives, weary travelers and tourists.</p>
