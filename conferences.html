    Located almost midway between Johannesburg and Durban, The PETRUS ROYAL HOTEL in Ladysmith forms a cost effective meeting point for local commerce and industry, and is also a central and convenient venue for combined staff from other areas.
     
    The functions management at the PETRUS ROYAL HOTEL understand corporate needs in terms of motivation and team building, and can assist your coordinator with all aspects of planning for maximum results.
     
    Six individual meeting rooms are available, from the intimate Mayors Chambers to Sir Reay's' where up to 200 delegates can be accommodated.
     
    Our staff will assist with decoration and layout for theme meetings and conferences, and off-site tours and excursions can be arranged to suit your requirements.
     
    Talks about siege history, and optional short tours to historical sites in the area provide diversion when required.
     
    Our different and interesting restaurants offer menus to suit your requirements, from light lunches to full dinners, and sumptuous breakfasts.</p>
